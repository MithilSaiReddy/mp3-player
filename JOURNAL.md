# Day 1[Jul 10 2025]
After successfully failing the first project Bujji which could not be done because of my lack of knowledge in Hardware. i completely lost the motivation and thought of leaving this event for my good but few days back I got free stickers from Hackclub regarding this event. ***I thought why not a last chance***. So now I came with something simple .

## Project:- Mp3-player
I know it's very simple but for some one starter like me it's so much.The main limitation i kept is to not use any micro controllers like Arduino or Pi or any other .. and also make it portable so that i can use it anywhere and be less depend on my mobile 
I think this project can be completed shorty as it's main task is to find the right hardware and how to arrange them and design case
